### Description ###
I like math. I like programming. I am not a formally trained jedi in either.
But I like to pretend

### Project Euler ###
Project Euler has a set of math problems on its website.

These problems are not interesting of themselves. They are rather bland.

But the solutions to them cannot always be computed by hand. 
You have to write code to compute the solutions efficiently. Otherwise they will take ages
to solve.

I have used project Euler problems to teach myself some Java and python.

I have also used it to become a persistent and creative problem solver.

### Project Rosalind ###
Very similar to Project Euler - except this time it involves sequence data from genomics.
It's a training ground of sort for bioinformaticists.
